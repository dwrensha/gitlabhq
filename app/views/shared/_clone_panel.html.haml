    To access this repo from a git client, first generate an API webkey, which will be of the form
    &lt;endpointUrl&gt;#&lt;token&gt;. The repo will then be available at
    &lt;endpointUrl&gt;/#{project.path_with_namespace}.git,
    protected by &lt;token&gt; as a password. You can use any username.
    The token not only provides authorization but also identifies this specific GitLab instance.
